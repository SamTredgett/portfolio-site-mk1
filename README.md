# Portfolio Website

This is the HTML and CSS section of my portfolio site, i'm implementing these
designs based off of designs that i've already drawn on paper or in Figma. 

This update includes patches to issues with form validation, this includes bugfixes 
for browser validation fighting with javascript form validation. Also setting up 
clearer error messaging for the notation and working in some better timings on
on the site as a whole.
